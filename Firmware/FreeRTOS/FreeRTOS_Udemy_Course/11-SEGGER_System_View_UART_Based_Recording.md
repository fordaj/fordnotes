# SEGGER SystemView Continuous Recording Over UART

- Requires either a J-Link debugger, or reflashing the FW of an STM32 board to convert ST-Link into J-Link

    - DOWNSIDE: Reflashing to J-Link FW disables debugging in STM32CubeIDE

    - Real-Time Recording over UART is a better option

- NEED FTDI CHIP TO CONTINUE :(
