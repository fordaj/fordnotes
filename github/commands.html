        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        <h3>Terminal Commands</h3>
        <p>
            While Google Drive publicized collaborative project work on an
            unprecedented scale, GitHub is still regarded as an essential
            software and skill among many employers and coders. Below is a list
            of commands I find myself needing to remember, somewhat organized in
            the typical order a project will use them in. All commands can be
            run in Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows).
        </p>
        <h4>Configure git</h4>
        <p>
            When using the git terminal on a new computer, you should begin by
            setting your username and email.
        </p>
        <code>git config --global user.name "YourFirstName YourLastName" 
git config --global user.email "yourEmailAddress@emailProvider.com"</code>
        <h4>Create a repository</h4>
        <p>
            If you do not already have a folder containing files for your new
            GitHub project, go ahead and create one and navigate to it.
        </p>
        <code>cd Documents mkdir myProject cd myProject</code>
        <p>
            If you already have a folder containing your project files, navigate
            to it.
        </p>
        <code>cd Documents/myProject</code>
        <p>To create a repository, run the following command.</p>
        <code>git init</code>
        <h4>Push files to repository</h4>
        <p>
            To save your files on GitHub's servers (referred to as "pushing to a
            repository"), you need to run a few commands. To check to see if you
            have any files waiting to be pushed:
        </p>
        <code>git status</code>
        <p>
            If any files show up in red, they are waiting to be pushed. You can
            add all files (aka "staging for commit"):
        </p>
        <code>git add .</code>
        <p>or add individual files:</p>
        <code>git add myFile.txt mySecondFile.txt</code>
        <p>If you decide not to save a file:</p>
        <code> git rm mySecondFile.txt</code>
        <p>
            Once you are ready to commit for pushing, use the following command
            with your own description of what you've worked on:
        </p>
        <code>git commit -m "Created a repository and pushed initial files."</code>
        <p>If your commit is ready to go, you can go ahead and push:</p>
        <code>git push</code>
        <h4>Branching</h4>
        <p>
            In most projects, it is a good idea to create branches - especially
            if there are collaborators involved. Branches allow us to safely
            alter code files without breaking the master files. I like to create
            a branch with my name:
        </p>
        <code>git branch andy</code>
        <p>To see which branches have been created in your repository:</p>
        <code>git branch -a</code>
        <p>Now, we can work in my new branch:</p>
        <code>git checkout andy</code>
        <p>
            Pushing files to a branch is similar to the process described above.
            Typically, it will look like this:
        </p>
        <code>git status git add . git commit -m "My message goes here" git push origin andy</code>
        <p>
            Notice the push command has changed a bit - there are origin based
            branches, and remote branches. Remote branches can be thought of as
            a sub branch in a different location. Remote branches have yet to be
            necessary in my projects, so I don't really use them.
        </p>
        <h4>Merging branches</h4>
        <p>
            You've just surpassed some significant milestone in your project -
            and it's time to merge your branch into the master branch. Start
            with switching back to your master branch, and then you can merge:
        </p>
        <code>git checkout master git merge andy</code>
        <p>
            Sometimes, if you have a collaborator who was working in the same
            files, you may run into code conflicts. Git makes it clear where the
            conflicts are in the files - you'll just have to go through and
            delete any code that should not be pushed to master. Once you do,
            you can run git merge again to see if you addressed all conflicts.
            Once you've merged, you may with to delete your branch:
        </p>
        <code>git branch -d andy</code>
        <h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>
        <p>
            Primarily, I prefer to work in the MacOS, so Visual Studio is not an
            option. Visual studio code takes some setting up for languages like
            c++, but is definitely worth the time. Github and VSCode mesh
            together extremely well with several features. In the lower left of
            the window, you can see which branch you are in:
        </p>
        <img src="branch.png" height="20px" />
        <p>
            Above that, you can see a timeline of all of your committed
            versions:
        </p>
        <img src="timeline.png" height="50px" />
        <p>
            Lastly, in your file tree, you can see color coded and status
            symbols representative of uncommitted and modified files.
        </p>
        <img src="fileTree.png" height="200px" />
        <h4>Closing notes</h4>
        <p>
            Having not used GitHub for very long, I find myself caught in a
            branching error where it becomes misaligned from what is on my
            repository's website. When in doubt, use their website as the true
            master code. Merging is pretty clear in their website, and doesn't
            require a learning curve. Sometimes, I find myself in a jam, and
            deleting and resetting my branches locally isn't syncing things up
            with the master. The best way to get a clean slate that is synced up
            with the repository's website, is to delete the repository from your
            file explorer, and then clone back into it again.
